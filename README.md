# gans
This repoitory contains projects undertaken in an attempt to understand gans, and implement them in many different areas.
The projects start from very simple sequence generation, and I won't like to place a limit on the other end. SKY IS THE LIMIT 
(or probably something beyond sky in our age :))

## Going Through Projects and Possibly Implementing Projects Yourselves
I plan to implement most of these projects in tensorflow. In most cases, installing tensorflow should be sufficient.

### Project 1:- Sequence Generation
This is a very simple implementation of the GAN paper by Ian Goodfellow (Generative Adversarial Nets) https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661
